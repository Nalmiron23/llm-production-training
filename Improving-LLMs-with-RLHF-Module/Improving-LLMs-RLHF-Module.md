# Improving LLMs with RLHF Module

## Improving LLMs with RLHF

### Goals
Equip students with knowledge and practical skills for implementing **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**.

---

## Overview

This short module focuses on **RLHF**â€”a technique used to align large language models with human preferences. By integrating **human feedback** into the training loop, we amplify desirable patterns and improve the quality and alignment of LLM outputs.

### Lesson 1: Deep Dive into RLHF

In this lesson, we will:

- Explore the **mechanics** of RLHF.
- Understand the **three-stage pipeline**:
  1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
  2. **Reward Model Training**
  3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- Discuss **real-world applications**, including how RLHF underpins models like ChatGPT.
- Examine challenges such as feedback bias, reward hacking, and stability of PPO training.

### Lesson 2: Improving Trained Models with RLHF

This lesson offers a **practical guide** to using RLHF as a fine-tuning method for LLMs.

We will:

- Reuse the fine-tuned model from previous lessons (e.g., instruction-tuned with SFT).
- Train a **Reward Model** using ranked outputs or human annotations.
- Use the **TRL (Transformers Reinforcement Learning)** library to perform PPO-based updates.
- Evaluate the improvements in model behavior post-RLHF fine-tuning.
