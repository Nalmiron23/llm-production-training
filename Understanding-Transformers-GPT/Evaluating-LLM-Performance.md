# Evaluating LLM Performance

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore two crucial aspects of language model evaluation: **objective functions** and **evaluation metrics**.

Objective functions, also known as **loss functions**, play a vital role in guiding the learning process during model training. On the other hand, **evaluation metrics** provide interpretable measures of the model's capabilities and are used to assess its performance on various tasks.

We will dive into the **perplexity** evaluation metric, commonly used for LLMs, and explore several benchmarking frameworksâ€”such as **GLUE**, **SuperGLUE**, **BIG-bench**, **HELM**, and **FLASK**â€”that help comprehensively evaluate language models across diverse scenarios.

## Objective Functions and Evaluation Metrics

### Objective Functions

The **objective function** (or loss function) is a mathematical formula used during training. It gives a loss score to the model based on its parameters. The learning algorithm computes gradients of this loss function and updates the parameters to minimize it.

For LLMs, the typical objective function is **cross-entropy loss**, as language modeling is essentially a classification problemâ€”predicting the next token.

### Evaluation Metrics

**Evaluation metrics** are used to assess model performance in a human-interpretable way. These are not used directly in training, so they donâ€™t need to be differentiable. Common examples include accuracy, F1-score, and mean squared error.

For LLMs, evaluation metrics can be categorized into:

* **Intrinsic Metrics**: e.g., *perplexity* (related to the training objective).
* **Extrinsic Metrics**: performance on downstream tasks, e.g., *GLUE*, *SuperGLUE*, *BIG-bench*, etc.

## The Perplexity Evaluation Metric

**Perplexity** quantifies how well a language model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity means better predictive performance.

Given a sentence, perplexity normalizes the model's predicted probability for each token using the geometric mean and takes the reciprocal:

```python
import numpy as np

probabilities = np.array([0.4, 0.27, 0.55, 0.79])
sentence_probability = probabilities.prod()
sentence_probability_normalized = sentence_probability ** (1 / len(probabilities))
perplexity = 1 / sentence_probability_normalized
print(perplexity)  # Output: 2.148...
```

Improved probabilities (model improvement):

```python
probabilities = np.array([0.7, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9])
sentence_probability = probabilities.prod()
sentence_probability_normalized = sentence_probability ** (1 / len(probabilities))
perplexity = 1 / sentence_probability_normalized
print(perplexity)  # Output: 1.516...
```

## The GLUE Benchmark

**GLUE** (General Language Understanding Evaluation) includes 9 tasks:

* **Single-Sentence**: grammaticality (CoLA), sentiment (SST-2)
* **Similarity/Paraphrase**: paraphrasing (MRPC, QQP), sentence similarity (STS-B)
* **Inference**: entailment (RTE), QA (QNLI), pronoun resolution (WNLI)

The final score is an average over all tasks.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of all the **acronyms** used in the **GLUE Benchmark** and what they stand for:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **CoLA** â€” *Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability*

* **Task**: Determine whether a sentence is grammatically acceptable.
* **Example**: "The boy laughed." â†’ Acceptable.
  "The boy laughing." â†’ Not acceptable.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **SST-2** â€” *Stanford Sentiment Treebank (binary classification)*

* **Task**: Sentiment analysis (positive or negative sentiment).
* **Example**: "A thrilling and emotionally resonant film." â†’ Positive.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **MRPC** â€” *Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus*

* **Task**: Determine whether two sentences are paraphrases of each other.
* **Example**:
  S1: "He said the food was great."
  S2: "He mentioned the food was excellent." â†’ Paraphrase.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **QQP** â€” *Quora Question Pairs*

* **Task**: Identify if two questions asked on Quora are semantically equivalent.
* **Example**:
  Q1: "How can I learn to cook?"
  Q2: "What is the best way to start learning to cook?" â†’ Equivalent.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **STS-B** â€” *Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark*

* **Task**: Measure the similarity between two sentences on a continuous scale (typically 0 to 5).
* **Example**:
  S1: "A man is playing a guitar."
  S2: "A person is playing music on a guitar." â†’ Similarity Score: 4.8

---

### ðŸ”¹ **RTE** â€” *Recognizing Textual Entailment*

* **Task**: Determine if a premise entails (implies) a hypothesis.
* **Example**:
  Premise: "All dogs bark."
  Hypothesis: "My dog barks." â†’ Entailment.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **QNLI** â€” *Question Natural Language Inference*

* **Task**: Determine if the context sentence contains the answer to a given question.
* **Example**:
  Question: "Where is the Eiffel Tower?"
  Context: "The Eiffel Tower is in Paris." â†’ Entailment.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **WNLI** â€” *Winograd Natural Language Inference*

* **Task**: Coreference resolutionâ€”decide which noun a pronoun refers to.
* **Example**:
  Sentence: "The city council refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence."
  Who feared violence? â†’ "The city council."

---

## The SuperGLUE Benchmark

**SuperGLUE** extends GLUE with harder tasks:

* Boolean QA
* Commonsense reasoning
* Coreference resolution
* Textual entailment
* Word sense disambiguation

It includes **human baseline scores** and **overall task averaging** for evaluation.

## The BIG-bench Benchmark

**BIG-bench** is a living benchmark of 200+ diverse tasks:

* Code writing, reasoning, games, linguistics
* JSON-based and programmatic tasks
* Evaluates language model scaling and calibration

It's open-source and continually evolving via community contributions.

## The HELM Benchmark

**HELM** (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models) standardizes evaluation with 3 goals:

1. **Coverage**: diverse domains, languages, tasks
2. **Multi-metric**: accuracy, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, efficiency, calibration
3. **Standardization**: consistent few-shot prompt setup across models

HELM evaluates over 30 models and highlights trade-offs beyond accuracy.

## The FLASK Benchmark

**FLASK** (Fine-grained Language Model Evaluation based on Alignment Skill Sets) assesses models on 12 targeted skills:

* Logical correctness & efficiency
* Factuality, commonsense
* Comprehension, insightfulness
* Completeness, metacognition
* Readability, conciseness, harmlessness

This breakdown provides diagnostic insight into model strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we explored the importance of objective functions like **cross-entropy loss** and evaluation metrics like **perplexity** in assessing LLMs. We also introduced several powerful benchmarking suitesâ€”**GLUE**, **SuperGLUE**, **BIG-bench**, **HELM**, and **FLASK**â€”that provide multi-dimensional insights into model performance.
