# Controlling LLM Outputs

## Introduction

In this lesson, we explore various methods and parameters for controlling the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We'll discuss different decoding strategies and how specific parameters can be tuned to guide text generation behavior.

## Decoding Methods

Decoding methods determine how an LLM chooses the next word/token during text generation. These methods aim to balance **accuracy**, **diversity**, and **efficiency**.

### Greedy Search

* Picks the token with the **highest probability** at each step.
* Fast and deterministic.
* Can lead to repetitive or suboptimal outputs.

### Sampling

* Picks the next token **randomly based on probability distribution**.
* Enables **diverse** outputs.
* May reduce coherence.

### Beam Search

* Keeps track of top **N most probable sequences** at each step.
* Produces more consistent results.
* Can be slower and miss high-quality sequences masked by early low-probability choices.

### Top-K Sampling

* Samples only from the top **K most likely tokens**.
* Adds controlled randomness while reducing incoherence.

### Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling

* Samples from the **smallest set of tokens** with a cumulative probability > `p`.
* Balances quality and diversity dynamically.

## Parameters That Influence Text Generation

### Temperature

Controls **randomness** in predictions:

* **Low temperature (< 1)**: More conservative and focused.
* **High temperature (> 1)**: More creative and diverse.
* **Temperature = 1**: No scaling, neutral setting.

**Technical Insight:**

* Applies to the **logits** (raw token scores) before softmax.
* Affects the probability distribution over the vocabulary.

### Stop Sequences

* Predefined sequences that **halt generation** once encountered.
* Useful for delimiting output structure (e.g., stopping at "### End").

### Frequency Penalty

* Discourages repeated use of the **same token** based on its frequency in the generated text.

### Presence Penalty

* Penalizes tokens that **have already appeared**, regardless of frequency.

These parameters are adjustable in many LLM APIs and libraries such as Hugging Face.

## Conclusion

To effectively control the behavior of an LLM, we can:

* Choose appropriate **decoding strategies** (greedy, beam, sampling).
* Adjust **temperature, stop sequences, and penalties** to shape the style and accuracy of outputs.

These tools allow us to tailor LLMs for tasks that require either **focused, deterministic responses** or **creative, varied outputs**, depending on the application.
