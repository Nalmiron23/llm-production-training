# Mitigating Hallucinations and Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs)

This document summarizes advanced techniques to reduce hallucinations and biases in LLMs, as discussed in the "Train & Fine-Tune LLMs for Production" course. These practices improve factual accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment in generative AI systems.

## 1. The Importance of Data

* **High-Quality, Diverse Data**: I need to utilize high-quality, diverse datasets that represent various demographics and perspectives to minimize inherent biases. Using datasets that represent varied demographics and perspective its a must. 
* **Filtering**: Remove low-quality, opinionated, or fictional content.
* **Synthetic Balancing**: Generate synthetic data to balance underrepresented classes or scenarios, aiding in bias mitigation.

## 2. Tweak Inference Parameters

* **Temperature**: Controls randomness in output; lower values (e.g., 0.1–0.3) yield more deterministic responses, reducing hallucinations.
* **Top-k / Top-p Sampling**: Limit the token selection pool to the top-k probable tokens or top-p cumulative probability, enhancing response relevance.
* **Penalties**: Adjust `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` to avoid repetition.

## 3. Prompt Engineering

* **Explicit Task Instructions**: Be clear and specific about what you want.
* **Few-shot Examples**: Guide the model with 1–3 contextual examples.
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Ask the model to reason step-by-step for complex tasks.

## 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Deep Memory

Integrating external knowledge sources can ground model responses:
* **RAG Framework**: Combine retrieval mechanisms with generation models to fetch relevant information, reducing hallucinations.
* **Knowledge Graphs**: Incorporate structured data to provide factual grounding for model outputs.
* **Memory**: Maintain a memory of past interactions to inform current responses, enhancing coherence and relevance.

## 5. Fine-Tuning

Tailoring models to specific tasks or domains can improve accuracy:
* **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**:  Train models on data pertinent to a particular field to enhance relevance and reduce errors.
* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Use Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback to reward helpful behavior.
* **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Utilize techniques like LoRA or QLoRA to fine-tune models efficiently without extensive computational resources.

## 6. Constitutional AI

* **Principle-Based Alignment**: Define a set of values or "constitution" for ethical behavior.
* **Self-Supervision**: Train the model to critique and improve its outputs.
* **AI-Based Feedback**: Replace human raters with model-driven critiques aligned to the constitution.

---

## 7. Continuous Monitoring & Evaluation

* **Bias Detection**: Use tooling to audit model responses across demographics.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Involve human validators in feedback loops.
* **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Track factuality, coherence, fairness, and safety over time.

By combining these approaches, us developers can build LLMs that are safer, more accurate, and aligned with human values.
