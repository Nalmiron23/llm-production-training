# Mitigating Hallucinations and Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs)

This document summarizes advanced techniques to reduce hallucinations and biases in LLMs, as discussed in the "Train & Fine-Tune LLMs for Production" course. These practices improve factual accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment in generative AI systems.

## 1. The Importance of Data

* **High-Quality, Diverse Data**: Use datasets that represent varied demographics and perspectives.
* **Filtering**: Remove low-quality, opinionated, or fictional content.
* **Synthetic Balancing**: Generate synthetic samples to counteract underrepresentation.

---

## 2. Tweak Inference Parameters

* **Temperature**: Lower values (e.g., 0.1–0.3) reduce randomness and hallucinations.
* **Top-k / Top-p Sampling**: Restrict token choices to improve coherence.
* **Penalties**: Adjust `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` to avoid repetition.

---

## 3. Prompt Engineering

* **Explicit Task Instructions**: Be clear and specific about what you want.
* **Few-shot Examples**: Guide the model with 1–3 contextual examples.
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Ask the model to reason step-by-step for complex tasks.

## 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Deep Memory

* **RAG**: Integrate vector-based document retrieval into the prompt pipeline.
* **Knowledge Graphs**: Use structured semantic knowledge to enhance grounding.
* **Memory**: Keep contextual memory to maintain conversation consistency.

---

## 5. Fine-Tuning

* **Domain Adaptation**: Fine-tune models with domain-specific data.
* **RLHF**: Use Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback to reward helpful behavior.
* **PEFT**: Apply techniques like LoRA / QLoRA for efficient fine-tuning.

---

## 6. Constitutional AI

* **Principle-Based Alignment**: Define a set of values or "constitution" for ethical behavior.
* **Self-Supervision**: Train the model to critique and improve its outputs.
* **AI-Based Feedback**: Replace human raters with model-driven critiques aligned to the constitution.

---

## 7. Continuous Monitoring & Evaluation

* **Bias Detection**: Use tooling to audit model responses across demographics.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Involve human validators in feedback loops.
* **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Track factuality, coherence, fairness, and safety over time.

By combining these approaches, us developers can build LLMs that are safer, more accurate, and aligned with human values.
