# Fine-Tuning LLMs Module

## Overview

The **Fine-Tuning LLMs** module equips students with both the **knowledge** and **practical skills** necessary to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), accompanied by real code examples. It also addresses the use of **CPUs for fine-tuning**, an important consideration in resource-limited environments.

This module dives into the methodologies behind LLM fine-tuning and zooms into **instruction tuning techniques** such as **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** and **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, providing hands-on guidance for domain-specific applications and practical implementation.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the challenges and approaches to fine-tuning LLMs.
- Explore instruction-tuning methods like **SFT**, **RLHF**, and **LoRA**.
- Apply LoRA and SFT to real-world datasets.
- Experiment with domain-specific use cases in **finance** and **medicine**.
- Use services like **Cohere** for scalable fine-tuning tasks.
