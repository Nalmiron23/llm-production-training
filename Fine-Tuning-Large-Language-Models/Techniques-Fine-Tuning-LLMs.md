# Techniques for Fine-Tuning LLMs

## Introduction

In this lesson, we explore the core techniques for **fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)** for enhanced performance on specific tasks. We'll discuss why fine-tuning is needed, instruction fine-tuning, and various methods including **Full Fine-Tuning**, **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**, and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**. We'll also highlight the efficiency gains from **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** using Hugging Face's PEFT library.

## Why We Fine-Tune LLMs

While pretraining gives LLMs a general understanding of language, it **lacks specialization** for complex or domain-specific tasks.

For instance, a pretrained model might generate fluent text, but fail to perform **financial sentiment analysis** accurately. Fine-tuning adapts the model by training it on **task-specific data**, improving performance in specific contexts such as healthcare, finance, or law.

However, **full fine-tuning** of LLMs (which can have billions of parameters) is expensive and resource-intensive. This makes alternative, more efficient techniques like **LoRA** and **PEFT** especially valuable.

## Instruction Fine-Tuning

**Instruction fine-tuning** trains an LLM to follow textual instructions rather than just continue text.

For example, given:  
> ‚ÄúAnalyze the sentiment of this text and tell us if it's positive.‚Äù

An instruction-tuned model will perform **sentiment classification**, not just generate continuation text.

### Why Use It?
- Promotes **generalization** across new tasks.
- Reduces the amount of **task-specific data** required.
- Adds **control and safety** over model outputs.

## Techniques for Fine-Tuning LLMs

### ‚úÖ Full Fine-Tuning
- Adjusts **all model parameters**.
- High accuracy, but **very expensive**.
- Requires significant compute (e.g., many GPUs).

### ‚úÖ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- Introduces **trainable low-rank matrices** into specific layers.
- Reduces GPU usage and training cost.
- Trains a **small subset of parameters**.
- Variants: **QLoRA** (adds quantization for even more memory savings).

### ‚úÖ Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- Fine-tunes a pretrained model on **task-specific labeled data**.
- Lower cost than full fine-tuning, but still resource-heavy.

### ‚úÖ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Improves alignment with human preferences.
- Uses human-labeled outputs to **optimize rewards**.
- Often used after SFT to refine model behavior.
- Alternatives:
  - **DPO**: Direct Preference Optimization
  - **RLAIF**: Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback

## Efficient Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face PEFT

**PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) methods reduce training and storage cost by updating only **a small portion of parameters**.

### Benefits:
- Requires **less compute**.
- Generates **smaller model checkpoints**.
- **Better generalization** in low-data or out-of-domain tasks.

### Popular PEFT methods include:
- **LoRA**
- **Prompt Tuning**
- **Adapters**

The **Hugging Face PEFT library** integrates seamlessly with:
- ü§ó Transformers
- ü§ó Accelerate

This makes it easy to implement parameter-efficient training on nearly any transformer model.
