## ✅ Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to:

- Create and manage Deep Lake datasets  
- Load data using both Deep Lake and PyTorch loaders  
- Query and filter with **TQL**  
- Use version control and samplers for high-quality training  

Deep Lake is a powerful backend for streaming, querying, and managing data at scale — especially when working with LLMs.
