# Deep Lake and Data Loaders

## Introduction

In this lesson, we focus on **Deep Lake**, a powerful AI data system that merges the capabilities of **Data Lakes** and **Vector Databases**. We'll explore how Deep Lake can be used for training and fine-tuning LLMs, especially through its efficient data streaming.

By the end of this lesson, you'll know how to:

- Create and manage a Deep Lake dataset  
- Add and retrieve data efficiently  
- Use Deep Lake and PyTorch data loaders
