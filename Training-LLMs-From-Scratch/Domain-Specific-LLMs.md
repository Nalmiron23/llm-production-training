# Domain-Specific LLMs

## Introduction

Domain-specific Language Models are tailored for specific industries or use cases. Unlike generalized language models that attempt to comprehend a wide array of topics, domain-specific LLMs are finely tuned to understand a particular domain's unique terminology, context, and intricacies.

In this lesson, we’ll see what it takes to create a domain-specific LLM, how to do it, and what popular domain-specific LLMs are.

## When Do Domain-Specific LLMs Make Sense?

Domain-specific LLMs offer distinct advantages over their generalized counterparts in scenarios where precision, accuracy, and context are very important. They excel in industries where specialized knowledge is essential for generating relevant and accurate outputs. They're also helpful in certain safety-critical scenarios or where low latency and cost are required.

Two prominent industries where these models thrive:

- **Finance**: Personalized investment advice and strategy optimization.
- **Healthcare**: Understanding complex medical queries to enhance care.

Why not just use general-purpose LLMs?

General-purpose LLMs might have the domain knowledge within their pretraining data, but they aren’t always fine-tuned for domain-specific behavior or constraints. A general LLM might "know" the right answer but still respond inappropriately for specialized use cases unless steered properly during fine-tuning.

If the domain knowledge already exists in the pretraining data, fine-tuning is usually sufficient. If not, pretraining from scratch may be necessary.

## BloombergGPT

**BloombergGPT** is a proprietary, domain-specific 50B parameter LLM designed for finance.

- **Training Dataset**: "FinPile" — includes financial news, filings, press releases, and social media, mostly from Bloomberg archives (2007–2022).
- **Data Composition**: ~51% domain-specific, ~49% general-purpose.
- **Architecture**: Based on BLOOM (decoder-only Transformer), 70 layers, GELU, Chinchilla scaling laws.
- **Performance**: Beats models like GPT-NeoX and BLOOM-176B on financial tasks, though GPT-3 still wins in general tasks.

## The FinGPT Project

FinGPT is an open initiative to democratize financial LLMs:

1. **Curates open financial datasets**.
2. **Finetunes open-source LLMs** for use cases like sentiment analysis.

### Financial Sentiment Analysis

Financial sentiment isn’t just about emotion — it’s about implications for investors.  
Examples:
- Neutral text: `"Operating profit rose to EUR 13.1 mn from EUR 8.7 mn..."`
  - **Financial sentiment**: Positive
- Text with layoffs: `"Elcoteq has laid off tens of employees..."`
  - **Financial sentiment**: Negative

### Key Datasets

- **Financial Phrasebank**: 4,840 annotated sentences from financial news.
- **FIQA**: 17k headlines/microblogs tagged with sentiment.
- **Twitter Financial Dataset**: ~10k tweets labeled with sentiment.

A [notebook is available](#) for finetuning and making predictions using these datasets.

## Med-PaLM for the Medical Domain

**Med-PaLM** is Google's finetuned version of PaLM for medicine.

- **Med-PaLM 1**: Released late 2022; passed USMLE-style medical exams.
- **Med-PaLM 2**: Announced March 2023 with **86.5% accuracy** on USMLE-style questions.

This represents a major step in building trustworthy, expert-level medical LLMs.

## Conclusion

Domain-specific LLMs are specialized tools designed for nuanced understanding in areas where general-purpose models may fall short.

They are especially powerful in:

- **Finance**: BloombergGPT, FinGPT
- **Healthcare**: Med-PaLM

Whether by pretraining from scratch or finetuning, domain-specific models will continue to play a critical role in real-world applications requiring deep expertise.
