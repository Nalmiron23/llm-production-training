# Going at Scale with LLM Training

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will share some tips for training LLMs at scale, focusing on the **Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)** and its implementation in **DeepSpeed**. We explore how ZeRO optimizes memory and computational resources, its various stages of operation, and the benefits of DeepSpeed. We also touch on the **Hugging Face Accelerate** library. Finally, we discuss the importance of maintaining a **logbook of training runs** to manage potential challenges and instabilities during the training process.

## The Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)

Training Large Language Models can be a formidable task due to immense computational and memory requirements. ZeRO, implemented in DeepSpeed, allows training these models with fewer hardware resources.

**ZeRO** is a parallelized optimizer that drastically reduces memory use and computation overhead by distributing model states across GPUs/CPUs:
- **Weights**
- **Gradients**
- **Optimizer States**

This allows ZeRO-powered data parallelism to accommodate **models of any size** as long as there is enough aggregated device memory.

### The Stages of ZeRO

Each stage introduces optimizations on top of the previous:

- **Stage 1 ‚Äì Optimizer State Partitioning**  
  Reduces memory usage 4x. Suitable for 1.5B parameter GPT-2 on 8 V100 GPUs.

- **Stage 2 ‚Äì Gradient Partitioning**  
  Adds gradient partitioning for 8x memory savings. Enables training of 10B parameter GPT-2 on 32 V100 GPUs.

- **Stage 3 ‚Äì Parameter Partitioning**  
  Adds parameter sharding. Enables training trillion-parameter models on 512 GPUs.

- **Stage 3 Extra ‚Äì CPU/NVMe Offloading (ZeRO-Infinity)**  
  Offloads states to CPU/NVMe memory, allowing single-GPU training of massive models.

## DeepSpeed

**DeepSpeed** is a high-performance library for distributed deep learning, incorporating ZeRO and more:

- üöÄ **Scale**: Enables training models up to 100B parameters  
- ‚ö° **Speed**: Combines data/model parallelism for 5√ó throughput  
- üí∞ **Cost**: Cuts compute costs by up to 3√ó  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Usability**: Works with minimal code changes and integrates easily with PyTorch

## Accelerate and DeepSpeed ZeRO

[Hugging Face Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) allows integration of **DeepSpeed ZeRO** with minimal modifications.  
With Accelerate + ZeRO, you can **increase batch sizes**, **reduce OOM errors**, and **scale training** seamlessly.

## Logbook of Training Runs

Even with ZeRO and Accelerate, training LLMs at scale can result in instabilities.  
Spikes in the **loss function** or sudden divergence may require **manual intervention**.

üìù **Checkpoint Rollbacks** are often used to recover training:
- Restore a saved checkpoint
- Reduce the learning rate
- Resume training

üìò For example:
- [Meta‚Äôs 114-page training logbook](https://huggingface.co/blog/optdiary) for OPT-175B
- Hugging Face‚Äôs Flamingo reproduction had multiple rollbacks during loss divergence

Maintaining a logbook helps track changes, issues, and tuning choices during long training runs.
