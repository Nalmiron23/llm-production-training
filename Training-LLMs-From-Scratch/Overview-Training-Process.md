# Overview of the Training Process

## Introduction
In this lesson, we will provide an overview of the multiple steps involved in training LLMs, including preprocessing the training data, the model architecture, and the training process. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of the various steps involved in training large language models.

The training process begins with the selection of one or a combination of suitable datasets, proceeds with the initialization of the neural network, and ultimately concludes with the execution of the training loop. We will also discuss the process of saving the weights for future utilization. Although this process may seem challenging, we will break it down into steps and approach each one separately to aid your understanding of the intricacies involved.

## The Dataset

Whether you're training a general-purpose LLM or one specialized for a specific domain, curating a comprehensive and relevant dataset is the most crucial step. 

While transformer architecture dominates modern NLP, **dataset size and quality** remain the primary factors affecting performance.

Well-known public datasets include:

- **The Pile**
- **Common Crawl**
- **Wikipedia**

Each contains hundreds of billions of tokens, offering rich diversity for learning. Many of these are accessible publicly. For this course, weâ€™ve also prepared a **Deep Lake** repository with several datasets preloaded for practical use.

### Domain-Specific Datasets

If you're training a model for a particular domain, youâ€™ll need high-quality, task-specific dataâ€”possibly sourced via:

- Web scraping
- Publicly available APIs or datasets
- Internal company knowledge bases
- **Synthetic data generation** using foundation models

> ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** You can even use a general LLM to generate a synthetic dataset tailored to your use case.

Split the dataset into:
- **Training set** â€“ used to optimize the modelâ€™s parameters.
- **Validation set** â€“ monitors performance and prevents overfitting.

## The Model

The **Transformer** architecture is the foundation of nearly all modern LLMs. It uses **self-attention mechanisms** to understand relationships between words and phrases.

The transformer architecture powers models like GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT, and others.

You can implement transformers using:
- Raw frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**
- High-level tools like **Hugging Face Transformers**

The Hugging Face Hub allows easy access to pre-trained models such as **BLOOM** or **OpenAssistant**, making experimentation and transfer learning simpler.

## Training

Early foundational models (e.g., BERT) used the **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** objectiveâ€”masking some words and predicting them using both left and right context.

However, **Autoregressive Language Modeling**â€”used in GPT modelsâ€”is better for **generative tasks**. This approach predicts the next token in a sequence using only previous tokens (thanks to **causal or masked attention**).

### Training Loops

You have two main options for implementing your training loop:

1. **Manual loop** using PyTorch (full control, more complexity)
2. **Trainer class** from Hugging Face (easier setup)

The Hugging Face `Trainer` supports:
- Logging
- Evaluation
- Checkpoint saving
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Conclusion

Training LLMs involves considerable experimentation to find the best configuration. Using modern libraries and tools simplifies the process and accelerates development.

Key factors affecting training include:
- **Model size**
- **Dataset scale and quality**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**
