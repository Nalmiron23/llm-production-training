# Benchmarking Your Own LLM

## Introduction

In a previous lesson, we touched upon several methodologies for assessing the effectiveness of different language models. Even with various available methodologies, evaluating a large language model continues to pose significant challenges.

The primary difficulty lies in the subjectivity of what defines a "good" answer—especially for generative tasks like summarization, where correctness is often not binary. This makes objective evaluation complex across nearly all generative tasks.

In this lesson, we’ll explore how benchmarks offer a potential solution.

## Benchmarks Over Several Tasks

To overcome subjective evaluation, we rely on curated benchmarks that assess models across a variety of tasks—ranging from instruction-following and world knowledge to programming and commonsense reasoning.

Some popular benchmark datasets include:

- **AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)** – Grade-school science questions.
- **HumanEval** – Programming tasks from docstrings.
- **HellaSwag** – Tests commonsense inference.
- **MMLU** – Covers 57 tasks from various domains.
- **TruthfulQA** – Measures truthfulness across 817 real-world questions.

### Leaderboards

- [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard)
- [InstructEval Leaderboard](https://instructeval.github.io/)

These leaderboards often use overlapping tasks and metrics to ensure fair model comparisons.

## Language Model Evaluation Harness

[EleutherAI’s `lm-evaluation-harness`](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) is a benchmarking library capable of evaluating both open-source and API-based language models across 200+ tasks.

### Key Features

- Customizable for generative tasks
- Supports Hugging Face and OpenAI models
- Prompt standardization for fair comparison
- Task versioning for reproducibility
